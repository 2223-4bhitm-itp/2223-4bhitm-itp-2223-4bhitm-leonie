== The files in a rasa project
1. `nlu.yml` This is the place where you can add your training data intents and entities

2. `domain.yml` In this file you can include your actions, responses, slots, intentions and entities

3. `rules.yml` You can define the rules and forms in this file

4. `stories.yml` for defining stories

5. `config.yml` change the language, the policies of the responses and the pipeline. This file is used to customize responses of your bot

6. `actions.yml` You can write the actions in this file using python

7. `__init__.py` If you want to execute a specific command when starting the chatbot



== The main components of rasa

=== Responses

- These are the responses of the bot and could be found in  `domain.yml `
- the label of a response look like => `utter_<Some label>`
- You should change the policies in the `config.yml` if you want to manipulate the way your bot responses to the users

- The response can include:
   1. Text
   2. images
   3. Custom ui elements (markdown)
   4. Buttons


=== Slots
These are variables which has the ability to change the flow of the conversation +
example:

[source,md]
----
User: I want to order pizza, cola and 2 burgers
Bot: Pizza, cola and 2 bugers orderd successfully
----

- Slots could be defined and used in domain.yml
- another example `I want to book a flight to sydney`. In this case sydney is the variable and the bot would query all  records to response with a list which contains all available tickets
- You can set up slots using in your nlu, or you can create your own custom hook

==== mapping slots

- from an entity
- from text e.g a message from a user
- calling a specific intent
- custom slots

=== Intents

- We can define it as a specific category for input data of the user. An intent include many sentences, words , etc. which have the same meaning

[source,yaml]
----
 intent: mood_great
    examples: |
      - perfect
      - great
      - amazing
      - feeling like a king
      - wonderful

----

- The data inside an intent calls learning data. These could be generated using machine learning or the stories

==== rules

It defines how the response on a specific input should look like
example:

- If I say hello the bot should say hello
- If I say bye the bot should say bye

==== stories

These define the flow of a specific  conversation. The difference between a story and a rule is that the bot can learn more from a story and add some vocabs to the intents in the nlu file


=== Entities

- Entities can handle a specific input like the input of the telephone number
- There are 3 way to add entities to your `nlu.yml`
 1. Using regex
 2. Using pre-built rasa-modules
 3. Using machine learning
- You should include the entity in the `domain.yml` if you want to use it

- Entities can handle synonyms
- Entities can handle specific roles example:

[source,md]
----
- I want to book a flight from vienna to berlin
----

In this example you should use the entity to specify the location which is vienna in this  example and the destination which is berlin in this example +

- Entities can handle Groups. If 2 keywords or more which have the same functionality  example: +
I want to order `Pizza`,`Soup` and a `Sandwich`. +

These 3 highlighted words do not have a specific role. They belong to a specific group which could we call order

=== Rasa forms an actions

- If the slots are not filled then the form will keep asking for information

- actions are then the processes that should be done after getting all required information. This should be included in the `domain.yml` file and implemented in `actions.py`

- A form could be validated it using an action
