== Starting Leonie HOLO

NOTE: Default Location: first floor, on the left side

IMPORTANT: Pictures and detailed instructions will follow

=== Cables and periphery

Push Leonie a few meters forwards, so you can easily reach her back. Now open it and you should find:

* Cables - usually - on the bottom or middle shelf
* Keyboard with Mouse, Mic - on the very top shelf

=== Connect Power, Display and Ethernet

* Connect the power strip _(bottom)_ to an outlet
* Connect the ethernet-cable with an ethernet-port
** use the far left port, the others are not working properly
* Connect the HDMI Cable to the Monitor
** use the signal booster if needed

=== Start the Computer

* Press the start-button of the PC
** you can find it on the top-left in the middle of the case (biggest button)

=== Automation

A terminal window should now be shown

* press any Key

Leonie should now appear

* Wrong Screen?
** usw `WIN` + `SHIFT` + `ARROWS` to rearrange

Now everything should be working, and you can chat with Leonie

=== Chatting

You can ask her several questions, using the keyboard or the microphone. You can, for example,
try some fun stuff like this:

Wo befindet sich Prof. Stütz gerade.

Or just click on the questions Leonie suggests, which you can find on the left side of the screen, and see what happens.
