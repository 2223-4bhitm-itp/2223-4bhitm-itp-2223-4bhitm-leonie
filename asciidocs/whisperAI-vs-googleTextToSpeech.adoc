Google text to speech is a technology developed by Google that converts written text into natural-sounding speech.
It allows developers, publishers, and website owners to add speech output to their applications, documents, and websites.
It supports a wide range of languages, and can be used for a variety of purposes, including accessibility, education, and entertainment.


== Opposite
They are both used to convert information from one form to another.
It is difficult to make a comparison between Google Text-to-Speech and Whisper AI, as they are two different technologies.
Google Text-to-Speech is designed to generate natural-sounding speech from the written text, while Whisper AI is designed to generate realistic-sounding voice audio from text with the use of artificial intelligence.
