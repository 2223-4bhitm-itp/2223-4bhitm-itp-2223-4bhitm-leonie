== Leonie-3D

Leonie-3D or Leonie HOLO is a Chatbot locally running at HTL Leonding. It consists of a screen and a
HOLO-Installation where you can look at Leonie from different angles.
These 2 components are connected with each other. How you can start the Leonie HOLO is shown https://2223-4bhitm-itp.github.io/2223-4bhitm-itp-2223-4bhitm-leonie/leonie-startup[here].

== Leonie-2D
The frontend, backend and dashboard already exist.

=== Frontend
The https://student.cloud.htl-leonding.ac.at/d.pavelescu/frontend[Frontend] page is an alternative version of the HTL Leonding website
where Leonie is already included, so you can chat with her.


=== Backend
https://student.cloud.htl-leonding.ac.at/d.pavelescu/backend[Backend] runs on a Quarkus application.

=== Dashboard
On the https://student.cloud.htl-leonding.ac.at/d.pavelescu/dashboard/[Dashboard] you will see:

* Conversations (to view past conversations between users and Leonie)
* Intents (intention of a user)
* Stories (a story serves as an example of what a conversation can look like)
* Responses (answer by Leonie to a message from the user)
* Rules
* Domain
* Logs

The dashboard is designed to review past *conversations* between users and Leonie, so you can find possible
errors, bugs or questions she doesn't understand yet. Now you can, for expample, add an *Intent* with
*Stories* and *Responses* to fix the errors and improve Leonie's skills.


== The difference between Leonie 2D and Leonie 3D

Leonie 3D can answer some question, the 2D version doesn't understand. Because she is in 3D and animated, she can
for instance dance, talk, laugh, ...

The 3D version also has access to WebUntis, which means you can ask her questions about the locations
of teachers and the timetable.
